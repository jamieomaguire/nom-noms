## Nom Noms
### Encouraging mindful nutrition throughout the day

Nom-noms is a web app designed to encourage mindfulness whilst eating. It does this by utilising charts which represent the food that you have eaten throughout the day, and how good or bad you believe that food is.

By giving you the choice to decide whether the food is healthy or not, you will likely begin to start making healthier decisions when you eat.

Using ChartJs for it's beautiful SVG data visualisations and React for it's powerful UI rendering capabilities, I hope to build something that anyone can use with ease and even help people to improve what they eat as well.

This is the final year project on my Digital Media BSc(Hons) degree at the University of the West of England. The module is called Creative Technology Projects and is our equivalent to a dissertation. It heavily involves an array of research methods as well as design theory and practical skills.
